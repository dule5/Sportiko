# Sportiko – Sports Matchmaking and Community App
#### Video Demo:  
#### Description:

Sportiko is an Android application designed to connect people through sports. The app allows users to create sports games, join games created by other players and stay updated with the latest sports news in one place. It is built with Java and Android Studio and it stores user and game data using SQLite.

The goal of the project is to allow people to easily organize games and find enough players is often difficult. Sportiko makes this easier by providing a simple platform where games can be created, viewed and joined.

Users can register an account, log in, create a profile and then access the main features of the app. They can browse available sports games, create new ones by entering details such as location, time and number of required players, and view or join existing games.

In addition to game management, Sportiko also includes a Sports News section. This feature uses Retrofit and an external News API to fetch and display live sports headlines. Articles are shown in a scrollable list with pull-to-refresh functionality. For security reasons, the News API key is not included in the repository. To enable this feature, you can create a free key at newsapi.org and insert it into the project in the SportProject\app\src\main\java\rs\ac\singidunum\activities\SportsNewsActivity.java and there is a sport for "Your_Api_Key".

In this final project, I used many of the concepts learned throughout CS50, including problem solving, algorithms, data structures, memory management, and software design principles. Even though Sportiko is built as an Android app in Java, my understanding of programming fundamentals, debugging, data handling, and application structure all came from CS50. Building this project was both challenging and rewarding and it was a great way to turn what I learned in CS50 into something real and useful.
